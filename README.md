#Assignment2

PartA
1. For running the sweeps on wandb make isWandBActive = True
2. For running the best model on test dataset make isWandBActive = False and all the best hyperparameters will be fed to the model
3. buildModel creates an model for building a convolutional neural network.
4. train() is the main entry function to the program to train the CNN.
5. predictImages is predicting the images from the test data on best model.
6. visualizeFilters is visualizing the filters in the first layer from the test dataset.
7. guidedBackprop is applying guided backpropagation on the CONV5 layer.



PartB
1. For running the sweeps make isWandBActive = True
2. For running the best model make isWandBActive = False and all the best hyperparameters will be fed to the model
3. train() is the main entry function to the program
4. After training the best model, accuracy on test dataset will be evaluated and the output will be printed.
